#Autotextkeeper

Autotextkeepr lets retreive everything you have recently typed! Every time you press <kbd>enter</kbd> the text you just typed will be stored in the history.

####Startup
Install [Autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) and run [atk.ahk](https://github.com/q335r49/Autotextkeeper/raw/master/atk.ahk).


####Tips
- Only lines longer than 14 characters will be stored (Change in menu).
- Press <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>f1</kbd>, <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>f2</kbd>, or <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>f3</kbd> to send the first 3 lines.
- Press <kbd>win</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> to open the user interface.
- Use the input box to search: <kbd>enter</kbd> will send the best match.
- To send multiple lines, <kbd>shift</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-select those lines and press enter.
- Note: when editing an entry, you must use "{enter}" to send a line break and "{!}" to send "!" (since the "!" is reserved for alt).

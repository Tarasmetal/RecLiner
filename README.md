#Autotextkeeper

Autotextkeepr lets retreive everything you have typed! Every time you press <kbd>enter</kbd> the text you just typed will be stored in the history.

####Startup
Install [Autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) and download and run atk.ahk.


####Tips
- Only lines longer than %min_chars% characters will be stored.
- Press alt-f1, alt-f2, alt-f3 to send the first 3 lines.
- Press win-s to open the user interface.
- Use the input box to search: enter will send the best match.
- To send multiple lines, shift or ctrl-select those lines and press enter.
- Note: when editing an entry, you must use "{enter}" to send a line break and "{!}" to send "!" (since the "!" is reserved for alt).

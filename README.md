####Startup
Install [Autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) and run [atk.ahk](https://github.com/q335r49/Autotextkeeper/raw/master/atk.ahk).

####Intro
ComLHist ('Comeliest' or 'Command line history' .. I know, it's a stretch!) keeps a record of every line you type. When you press <kbd>enter</kbd>, <kbd>esc</kbd>, or <kbd>tab</kbd>, the line just typed will be stored in the history, which you can search by pressing the hotkey (<kbd>win</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> by default).  It's useful for remembering complicated command line entries, keeping a record of online chats, and as a library of quotes.
Pressing hotkey <kbd>f1</kbd> ... <kbd>f10</kbd> will send the first 10 entries, the 'presets'. You can modify presets by typing or pasting text into the search prompt and hitting the appropriate function key. More than 10 presets can be set, and since presets appear first in the log and in search results this may be a good way to differentiate between autotext and log entries.

####Tips
* When editing atk.log, use {enter} to send a line break and {!} to send "!".  See [www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm](www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/Send.htm) for a list of special characters.
* Only lines longer than 14 characters will be stored.
* To change the settings, edit the automatically generated init file atk.ini
